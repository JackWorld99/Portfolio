                    Hi, I&apos;m Wei Jian, you can call me Jack as well. I&apos;m a rookie fresh out of Software Engineering. I&apos;m a delusional rookie who wants to change the world with code.

                    To be honest, I was a computer idiot before high school. Although I had a computer at home, my parents restricted my access to the Internet from a young age because it was full of all kinds of violent and pornographic content. I only have the opportunity to use the computer when I have a computer class at school. At that time I didn&apos;t even know how to shut down the computer. I started to use the computer unrestricted after I graduated from high school. You can imagine how devastated I was, when I first got into programming in university, the code was like alien text to me. My grades in the first semester of university almost ended in failing grades. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the new environment of the university and the fact that I knew nothing about programming at the time, I began to wonder if I had chosen the wrong subject and whether I was not suitable for this path. I started searching for tutorials on YouTube, beginning with the basics. But I found that although the languages were different, they still had a lot in common, and after a period of study, I started to keep up. Computers and codes won&apos;t lie to you, it treats you with sincerity, if you enter an order to tell him to go left, he will never go right, and I think that&apos;s why I&apos;m so obsessed with it.

                    I&apos;m a inquisitive person, when I encounter new technologies or better code algorithms, I&apos;ll research how this technique works and find out as much information as possible. There was a period of time when I was often struggling to find books. In order to solve this problem, I came up with the idea of developing a book scraping application. I stayed up all night to study how to implement web scraping. I&apos;m the type of person who loses sleep when I find something new that interests me, it sounds crazy, but it brings me great satisfaction when a vexing problem is solved.

                    I enjoy the process of finding problems in life and turning my thoughts and ideas into reality. I enjoy the process of going from noob to proficient. Learn new things and go in different directions. Because of this personality, I know a little bit of everything but not proficient. I&apos;m committed to making complex things simple, the simpler the better. I don&apos;t like wasting time, I always try to get things done in the shortest time, and then leave the rest of the time for myself to do what I want to do. After all, life is short and it&apos;s not easy to find what you love to do and stick to what you like. My motto is to be happy and enjoy life every day.

                            UTAR&ensp;-&ensp;&ldquo;Universiti Tak Ada Rehat&rdquo; in Malay, which means it is a University without rest, the mantra often used by the lecturer of utar when giving assignments. The long semester is 14 weeks, and the short semester is 7 weeks. An average of five subjects are taken in a semester, and each subject has more than one assignment. It is a very fast paced university, and the schedule is full every day. I am either doing assignments or preparing for tests every day. although every day was very busy without university life, but every day was very fulfilling. Fortunately, I survived and finally graduated.

                            Foon Yew High School - The largest Chinese independent high school in Malaysia. That&apos;s right, this is the high school I went to. There are endless homework, tests, and classes six days a week. There are laughter, tears, and confusion, it&apos;s a place full of memories. I used to think that living here was like a year, but in retrospect it was actually the happiest time so far.
